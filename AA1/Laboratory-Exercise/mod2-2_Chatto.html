			<h1>
				Jojo's Bizarre Adventure
			</h1>
			<p>			
				This anime has a very "bizarre" story. It doesn't follow the 
				conventional anime plot, and it mainly focuses on having a 
				good/weird/adventurous moment instead of following a logical story. 
				The main characters of the anime are the Joestar family. Each
				 season focuses on the the adventure of one individual in this family. 
				 Also, all the seasons have a very diffrent style, tone, and vibe 
				from each other. This because, each adventure of a certain
				 individual is a greatly different experience.
