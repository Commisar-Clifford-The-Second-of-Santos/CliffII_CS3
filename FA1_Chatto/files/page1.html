                 <li>Spaces marines are genetically enhanced super soldiers.</li>
                 <li>They are genetically engineered by implanting 19 super organs into their teenage developing bodies.</li>
                 <li>They will grow into massive 7.5 feet tall “humans” that outperform every aspects of normal human beings.</li>
                 <li>Space Marines also don't age much. They will start to feel the effects of aging when they're 600 years old</li>
                 <li>They have minds as fast as computers, arms capable of lifting tons, legs that can run as fast as a sports car, and durability that can withstand missiles. </li>
                 <li> They are also very resistant to pain, in fact, they can’t even feel it. It is normal for space marines to continue fighting even with their arms cut off, legs broken, and holes in their torso.</li>
                 <li>They are also outfitted with one of the most advanced technological weapons and armor mankind has to offer.</li>
                 <li>Their armor can take on lasers, bullets, and even nukes. This armor is also very light and it doesn’t limit the user's dexterity.</li>
                 <li>Their guns are so deadly, they are technically machine guns that shoot rockets.</li>
                 <li>Space marines are grouped into chapters, there are 1000 space marines in a chapter. In the galaxy, there are 1000 chapters. All in all, at any given time, there are about one million space marines.</li>
