                 <li>The imperial Guard is the largest organization in the imperium of man.</li>
                 <li>These soldiers are the primary force of mankind against all the horrors of the galaxy.</li>
                 <li>The number of soldiers the imperium has is so vast. That there is no exact number for the imperial guard. There are countless billions of imperial guards and hundreds of thousands of regiments.</li>
                 <li>Each imperial Guard is very skilled. An imperial guard is more skilled, experienced, and disciplined than our average soldier.</li>
                 <li> Since the galaxy is home to trillions of murder space bugs, literal demons, and horrific aliens. It is normal for the imperium to lose millions or even billions in a war.</li>
                 <li>Even with the skills of the Imperial Guard. The main reason why they are a force to be reckoned with, is their sheer numbers. 100 million strong and ruthless alien warriors canâ€™t compete with 50 billion imperial guards.</li>
