                 <li>Titans, also known as god-machines. Are one of the most advanced pieces of technology produced by mankind.</li>
                 <li>They are literally walking fortresses with guns capable of obliterating cities.
</li>
                 <li>Titans come in a variety of types, they range from 15-60 meters tall.</li>
                 <li>They act like tanks on a battlefield. They support the soldiers as they destroy the enemy's key points and defenses. 
</li>
                 <li>They also provide morale to the troops. Their sheer size and majesticness can inspire even the most saddened soiler.
</li>
                 <li>Small titans are operated by a crew of 5 people. But in the larger type of titans, the crew could exceed 500. 
</li>
                 <li>Titans may seem impractical, and they are. But the Imperium of man, they don’t prioritize practicality. 
</li>
                 <li>You can make a sensible argument for the titan’s impracticality. But when a skyscraper-sized robot with a pair of 20-meter-long super-guns stomps in your direction, you will wish it was just simply a few tanks.  
</li>
