<p>To Organize your plans you need to make sure you list all of your activities in an organized and logical manner. Before we talk about how to list all these activities, I would like to tell you something about discipline. Discipline is the most important part of organizing your activities, without it, the whole thing is useless. Discipline is about forcing yourself to do these important plans even if you don't feel like it. Motivation is the best feeling in the world, but it's temporal. Discipline is what will make your dreams come true. Now that you know the importance of discipline, let's couple that with the methods on how to list your plans in an organized and logical way.</p>
